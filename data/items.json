    "description": "My first job was working as a library shelver in a library between the years of 2009â€“2013. This experience really shaped my interests and career and who I am. I saw that most shelvers listened to music when shelving but we never spoke about it, so I wanted to connect us throughout the sheet, and then I made a CD (it was the time we used CDs:) and designed the album cover and gave one to each shelver."
